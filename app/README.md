# Dcr Graph Process mining tool

This example uses [diagram-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js) to implement a modeler for dcr graph diagrams.
 
## About
 
Interactive web-based tool in React that supports modelling, simulation, conformance checking etc. of DCR graphs.
 
## Building
 
You need a [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) development stack with [npm](https://npmjs.org) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) installed to build the project.
 
To install all project dependencies execute
 
```
yarn
```

To run the application locally run

```
yarn start
```
 
Which should serve the application to http://localhost:5173/dcr-js. Note that ressources may not be loaded in locally, as the internal paths differ locally and hosted to github-pages.

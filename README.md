What are DCR Graphs? A novel [Business Process Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_management) notation is ideal for flexible processes, such as those in healthcare, municipal administration, or knowledge-intensive processes in general. The notation allows you to describe processes like a game, focusing on the rules.

For a formal definition of DCR graphs, please [read this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.4161.pdf).

The editor is based on the popular [Diagram-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js) web editor.
